important links to setup C++ in vscode:

 Visual Studio Code is a light weight editor compared to the other options. It's created by Microsoft and with proper extensions and configurations you can turn it into a solid C++ IDE, but it does require a little more configuring to get up and running. If you are on a slower machine, I recommend this option and building/running your C++ files using a terminal / console (VSCode has a built-in terminal to do this as well).

Microsoft also has some links to follow if you decide to go with VSCode:

- C/C++ for Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)

- Using GCC with Mingw-w64 (VSCode) (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)
